# My Work Porfolio
My goal with this project is to make a buisness porfolio to address my prior skills and abilities. I stride to make my webpage easy to read, orgainzed, and visually appealing on both the published page and on the code behind the scenes. I want an employer to easily read my content and my experiences, to grow my work profile and my own personal buisness. 

I added comments to the CSS file, as well as semantic HTML elements to make the code easy to interpret for a developer and the webpage itself. This further grow my knowledge on how the code is working and how I can apply these concepts to future projects. 

I added 'alt' attributes to my images to make the images more accesible, as well as added flexing properties and @media-screen to CSS to add more mobile support and to make the content easier to read on smaller screens.
