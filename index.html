                <p>Hello! My name is Zachary and I am learning how to code with CSS, HTML, and soon JavaScript! I am currently employed at a local school district as a level 1 IT Technician. I started my own buisness on social media where I forecast and teach about the weather! Many people refer to me as "Zach Frost". I am learning more code to build applications to expand my buisness and a career change into the developer field! </p>

                    <h2>Prework Study Guide</h2>
                    <p>This is the first challenge I worked on in the bootcamp! I built a basic web application that included all the basic materials in coding. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and using Dev tools!</p>

                <h2>Challenge 1</h2>
                <p>This Challenge was very fun to do! Unlike the Prework Study Guide, I was given starter code and was given the task of debugging and adding more code for accesibility standards. In this challenge, I added alt attributes, consolidated classes, and overviewed the CSS and HTML for reference, further expanding my knowledge on basic coding functions!</p>

                <h2>CSS Learning</h2>
                <p>With this week and this challenge, I dove deep into the specific code relating to CSS, including pseudoclases/elements, flexboxes, and color schemes! This challenge is heavily reliant on CSS and it really opened my mind to this language by testing and practicing orders and commands! I learned a lot from trial and error with the CSS coding and margins.</p>

                <p>I have been employed with a local school district for 5 years now, in this job, I do more "hands on" work where I do desktop/laptop repairs, software troubleshooting, server configurain and hard-drive imaging! We work with small amounts of code involving diskpart for imaging and cleaning flash-drives as well.</p>

                <h2>Weather Forecasting</h2>
                <p>I have always loved the world of weather since I was a toddler! After all these years, I never lost my passion for meteorology and I now started my own business involving it! I include detailed discussions and anyalisis on weather systems and I also do live storm chases!</p>
